      <description> again this is for my self reference:  Assume this is the production grade program we need to dockerize and run. package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func main() { fmt.Println(&amp;#34;saying hello to the world&amp;#34;) }  FROM golang:1.10-alpine as builder WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/shabinesh/prog COPY main.go . COPY vendor ./vendor RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o main . FROM alpine:latest RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates WORKDIR / COPY --from=0 /go/src/github.com/shabinesh/prog/main . CMD [&amp;#34;./main&amp;#34;]  </description>

      <description> Learning Japanese 1   Welcome to learning Japanese, this is how I am planning to learn Japanese without a teacher. I am writing this series for myself to keep track of my progress, more of notes.  I already have some materials given by my teacher and know some fundamentals. Here are some links I find very useful.    https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/    https://www.nhk.or.jp/lesson/english/syllabary/index.html    I am going to follow my teacher’s methods: learn the Hiragana characters, learn some words and create basic sentences  Laying the strong foundations: mastering the vowels    あ aa (pronounce a as in all)   い e (pronounce e as in enough)   う Uh    え é (pronounce e as in hey)   お ô (pronounce o as in Hospital)     Words with above characters    あい Love   あお Blue   いえ House   いいえ No   うえ Top   おい Nephew   あう Meet    Spoken helpers:     Yes is pronounced as ‘Hai’    No is pronounced as いいえ (e-e-a)   </description>

      <description>I wanted to share with my friends some of productivity practices I am trying to imbibe in my routine which are giving results. Writing this help me put my ideas in order and I can share without repeating. And here it is. For me being productive is to have more time. The judgement of what is required and what is not, what is worth perusing and what isn&amp;#39;t is a skill to develop.</description>

      <description>Summary:  What is SOLID? Golang&amp;rsquo;s embodiment of SOLID as a language design  This is again a post for myself, as a precursor to the common design pattern in game dev which is possibly a follow up post. The credits for any information put up here goes to Dave Cheney from where I have derived this material.
What is SOLID? The SOLID principles are the top five, rather important patterns usually found the Object oriented programming languages.</description>
